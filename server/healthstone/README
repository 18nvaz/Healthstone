Healthstone is an open source and lightweight system monitoring solution able to run many customizable health checks. It is composed of a dashboard server which runs on a Windows or Linux server, along with agents for Windows and Linux hosts that you wish to monitor. The Windows agent is a binary which runs as a service and connects to this dashboard, while the Linux agent is a Python script doing the same thing. The dashboard can be customized to send you notifications through email, Pushbullet or NodePoint tickets when a client stops checking in, or if any of the configured checks fails. Configuration is retrieved in the form of templates from the dashboard by all agents. Templates are stored in the templates folder and can be customized for your needs.

The server component runs the dashboard against which Healthstone clients can register. It can be run on a Linux server with Python 3.x and Apache installed, or a Windows server with IIS (with the CGI and ISAP features) and Python 3.x installed.

Installation procedure:

* Download healthstone.zip onto your server and unzip it where you want the files to live, for example C:\healthstone.
* Edit dashboard.py and configure the access code and notification settings you want.
* Run setup.bat as a local administrator on Windows, or create a virtual site linking to the www folder on Linux, making sure the script has write access to ../db.
* Log into the dashboard using a web browser, then click on 'Download agents' to download the agent packages.
