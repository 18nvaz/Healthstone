Healthstone dashboard
---------------------

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- IIS or Apache web server with CGI and ISAPI support

Installation:
- Download 'healthstone-server.zip' onto your server and unzip it where you want the files to live, for example 'C:\healthstone'.
- Edit 'dashboard.py' and configure the access code and notification settings.
- Run 'setup.bat' on Windows or link the the 'www' folder to an accessible location (for example, make a virtual site from http://localhost/healthstone pointing to that folder) on Linux, making sure the Python script has write access to '../db/'

Troubleshooting:
- If you get an error loading the site, make sure the rewrite engine is turned on in your web server configuration
- You may need to edit the 'web.config' or '.htaccess' files manually if your Python installation path is different
- If you get a 404 error on IIS, make sure you allow the script in 'ISAPI and CGI restrictions' inside of IIS Manager
