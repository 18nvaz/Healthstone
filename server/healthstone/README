Healthstone dashboard
---------------------

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- IIS or Apache web server with CGI support

Installation:
- Link the files in 'www' to an accessible location (for example, make a virtual site from http://localhost/healthstone pointing to that folder)
- Make sure the Python script has write access to ../db/

Troubleshooting:
- If you get an error loading the site, make sure the rewrite engine is turned on
- You may need to edit the 'web.config' or '.htaccess' files manually if your Python installation path is different
- If you get a 404 error on IIS, make sure you allow the script in 'ISAPI and CGI restrictions'
- Check your web server error log to find out more
