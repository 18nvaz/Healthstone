# Healthstone

Healthstone is an open source and lightweight Windows system monitoring service able to run dozens of customizable health checks. If any check fails, it can notify the Event Log, send emails, file a NodePoint ticket, run a custom program, or send a notification using Amazon SNS or Pushbullet. It runs on any Windows XP, 7, 8, Server 2008 or Server 2012 system. It can be used to monitor servers, or the state of Windows desktops in any environment, along with other services such as IIS, SQL Server, etc. There's also a smaller Linux client, and a Python dashboard available.
