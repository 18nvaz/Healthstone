Healthstone System Monitor
--------------------------

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Any Linux system

Installation:
- Copy the files to the host you wish to monitor or an accessible network location
- Edit 'healthstone.py' and configure the checks and notification settings
- Run 'sudo ./install.sh' to install the script on the local system

Crontab notes:
- The install script defaults to adding a 5 minutes crontab for running Healthstone. If you modify the interval value in healthstone.py you should modify that value in the install script as well
- You should remove the old crontab entry if you run the install script more than once
- If your Python 3.x installation is not in your PATH or at /usr/bin/python3 then you may have to edit the crontab
